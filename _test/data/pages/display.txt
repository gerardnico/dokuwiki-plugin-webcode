====== Webcode - Not displaying code block  ======

===== About =====
This is possible to cache code block with this syntax:

<file>
<code [display="none"]>
// cached
</code>
</file>
The ''display="none"'' syntax comes from the [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/syntax_highlighting|advanced syntax]]

===== Example =====

==== Note ====

  * The cached code blocked in the example below is written with this syntax.
<file javascript>
<code javascript [display="none"]>
console.log("A log from the cached block");
</code>
</file>


==== The example ====
 

<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0 renderingMode=story >
  * We should not see the cached code block (Only the bullet point of the list)

<code javascript [display="none"]>
console.log("A log from the cached block.");
</code>
  * We should see the code block below
<code javascript>
console.log("A log from the visible block");
</code>
  * In the result, we should see two log line (one from the cached block and one from the visible one)
</webcode>
